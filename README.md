# NeuralNetwork (nn)

Small C++ code to evaluate forward and backward passes in simple feed forward neural networks.
No external math libraries required, only modern C++11 features and data structures.

Documentation is lacking.
See `examples` and `tests` directory for some simple use cases.

## Installation

CMake is used for building the library.
For example to build in a separate directory:

```
$> mkdir build && cd build
$> cmake ../
$> make
```
