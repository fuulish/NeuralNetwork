# NeuralNetwork (nn)

Small C++ code to evaluate forward and backward passes in simple feed forward neural networks.
No external math libraries required, only modern C++11 features and data structures.

Documentation is lacking.

## Installation

CMake is used for building the library.
For example to build in a separate directory:

`$> mkdir build && cd build`
`$> cmake ../`
`$> make`
